# Employee-Productivity-in-Garments-Industry
Employee productivity is the foundation of the garment industryâ€™s trillion-dollar global trade revenue. 
When actual productivity falls short of the targets, significant losses may occur, highlighting a widespread industry issue. 
This research is centered around the substantial global demand for textile goods, which heavily relies on the productivity of garment employees. 

The project uses machine learning to explore the challenges of predicting employee productivity and aligning it with set targets. 
The study's impact would empower garment industry managers to make data-driven decisions for operational efficiency, recruitment, and training programs, 
while also establishing a fair performance appraisal system for employees. 

Furthermore, future scholars have the opportunity to enhance predictive modelling by combining multiple machine learning algorithms, 
including time-series analysis and other strategies. This collaboration could lead to improved outcomes.
